# SevenSins
Media College school DIY project <br><br>

We wanted to act fast when creating a game like the "oermens gevecht", where you have to spawn soldiers to defend your base. 
I learned to prototype fast and to make priorities. I had alot of fun working on this project. <br><br>

take a look at this code:<br><br>
